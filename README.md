# Program to calculate the consumption of isotopes of fuel elements in nuclear reactors

## Fuel Consumption

To calculate the mass of each isotope burned in the fuel element you need the product of the fuel volume[cm^3] by the fuel density[g/cm^3]
MAT_fuel_XX_VOLUME * MAT_fuel.

- Select the isotopes of interest
